# thanksgivingTicketSales
Create a project that handles ticket sales for the Thanksgiving Extravaganza. Children's tickets cost $6, adult tickets cost $10, and senior tickets cost $8. There is a transaction fee of $2 per person. The program will ask the user for the number of children, adults, and seniors, then display the total number of guests, the subtotal of those ticket prices, the transaction fee, and the grand total. After displaying the grand total, ask how much money the user is paying, and calculate the change. Assume the user will enter a whole number that is at least equal to the grand total (no invalid data). These numbers are all integers, for better display at this point.  Note that you must declare variables for all values. In the calculations, it is not allowed to write code like "fee = guests * 2" -- the number 2 must be a variable.


== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project.  We have an
[open {bug ticket, mailing list thread, etc.} ](INSERT_LINK) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
[check this resource](INSERT_LINK) for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
