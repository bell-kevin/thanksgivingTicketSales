# thanksgivingTicketSales
Create a project that handles ticket sales for the Thanksgiving Extravaganza. Children's tickets cost $6, adult tickets cost $10, and senior tickets cost $8. There is a transaction fee of $2 per person. The program will ask the user for the number of children, adults, and seniors, then display the total number of guests, the subtotal of those ticket prices, the transaction fee, and the grand total. After displaying the grand total, ask how much money the user is paying, and calculate the change. Assume the user will enter a whole number that is at least equal to the grand total (no invalid data). These numbers are all integers, for better display at this point.  Note that you must declare variables for all values. In the calculations, it is not allowed to write code like "fee = guests * 2" -- the number 2 must be a variable.
